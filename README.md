# Image-Search-Engine-using-HTML-CSS-Js

A web app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that uses the Unsplash API to search for images. Users can search for any keyword, view the results, and load more images using a 
"Show More" button. The project features a responsive design and dynamically adds new results below the existing ones.
